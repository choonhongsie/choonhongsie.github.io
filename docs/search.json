According to the United Nations, it is estimated that one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted on a global scale, totaling around 1.3 billion tons annually (FAO, 2011).\n\n\nWhat is Food Waste?\nAccording to the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO),\"food waste\" refers to the discarding or non-food use of products that are safe and nutritious for human consumption\nDo you know that household accounts for most of the food waste?\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Pie Chart\n          Bar Chart\n        \n      \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n  \n\n  The chart shows that households are the largest contributors to food waste, accounting for 61.1% of the total. This is followed by food services (26.2%) and retail establishments (12.7%).\n  \nWhich Country Generated the most Household Food Waste?\nLet's see it from the World Map \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, we can see that China, followed by India, has generated the most household food waste. This is not surprising as they are the most populous countries in the world.\nLet's take a closer look...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina and India, the two most populous countries in the world, also produce the most household food waste. In 2021, China produced an estimated 92 million metric tons of household food waste, while India produced 69 million metric tons. This accounts for nearly one-third of the world's total household food waste.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Top 10 and Bottom 10 Countries for Combined per-capita Food Waste?\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Top 10 Countries\n      Bottom 10 Countries\n      Bar Chart by Region\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  Top 10 Countries\nThe majority of the top 10 countries are situated in Sub-Saharan Africa (or Africa) and the Western Asia (or Middle East), regions known for their comparatively lower levels of socioeconomic development. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2021), Sub-Saharan Africa was projected experience the slowest economic growth compared to other region in the world in 2021. Additionally, Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita figures  of approximately USD$1626.28 and USD$6266.36, respectively, among the lowest in the world(O'Neill, 2023).\n\nBottom 10 Countries\nThe majority of the bottom 10 countries are exhibiting the lowest food waste per capita are situated in Western Europe, which is renowned as a highly developed region globally.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Food Waste in Singapore\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\nFood waste is a serious problem in Singapore, as it affects food security and puts pressure on resources. This is especially concerning given that Singapore imports over 90% of its food supply and is a land-scarce country (Towards Zero Waste, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Environment Agency (NEA) (n.d.), Singapore generated 763,000 tonnes of food waste in 2022 and this accounted for 11% of total waste. This amount has increased steadily over the years, and it is expected to continue to grow as the population and economy expand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood waste ranks among the top 3 type of waste generated in Singapore, trailing behind paper/cardboard and plastic waste. Both Ferrous metal and paper/cardboard have a recycling rate of 99%. The \"Others\"\" types is the combimnation waste type that accounts for less than 6% of the total waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        References\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Miquelis, P.
